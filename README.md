# AntTree.js

AntTree.js is a JavaScript library that provides an intuitive interface for web developers to manage the DOM and events using an analogy of ants and trees. The library simplifies basic scripting tasks while allowing the use of regular JavaScript alongside AntTree.js code.

**CURRENT STATE => AntTree.js is a conceptual library that is in the planning stages. Eventually it may become a good resource to developers learning JavaScript and web development.**

## Features

- **Simplified DOM Manipulation**: Use tree and branch structures to represent and manipulate the DOM.
- **Event Handling**: Utilize specialized scout ants for different event types.
- **Data Management**: Implement carrier ants to handle variables and data.
- **Extensible Classes**: Create custom functionality with queen ants.

## Getting Started

### Installation

The library is not yet available. When it is live you will be able to install AntTree.js via npm:

```
npm install anttree
```

## Usage

    ```javascript
    import { Tree, ClickScout, DataWorker, DataCarrier, QueenAnt } from 'anttree';

    // Create a new tree
    const myTree = new Tree();

    // Add branches and leaves
    const branch1 = myTree.addBranch('div', { id: 'branch1' });
    const leaf1 = branch1.addLeaf('p', 'This is a leaf');

    // Create ants with specific names
    const clickScout = new ClickScout((event) => console.log('Clicked!', event), { dataCarrier });
    const dataWorker = new DataWorker((data) => console.log('Working with', data));
    const dataCarrier = new DataCarrier('myData', 'Some data');
    const queenAnt = new QueenAnt('MyClass', class {
        constructor(name) {
            this.name = name;
        }
    });

    // Use ants to manipulate the tree
    branch1.addAnt(clickScout);
    leaf1.addAnt(dataWorker);
    myTree.addAnt(dataCarrier);
    myTree.addAnt(queenAnt);

    // Example of event triggering
    branch1.triggerEvent('click');
    ```

## AntTreeBark.js

AntTreeBark.js is an extension of AntTree.js that includes additional security features such as password protection and data obfuscation. It uses the same ant and tree analogy but adds guard ants to implement security checks and validation.

**CURRENT STATE => AntTreeBark.js is a conceptual library that is in the planning stages. Eventually it may become a good resource to developers learning JavaScript and web development.**

### Installation

You can install AntTreeBark.js via npm:

    ```bash
        npm install anttreebark
    ```

## Usage

Here's an example of how to use AntTreeBark.js:

    ```javascript
    import { Tree, ClickScout, DataWorker, DataCarrier, QueenAnt, GuardAnt } from 'anttreebark';

    // Create a new tree with security features
    const myTree = new Tree();

    // Add branches and leaves
    const branch1 = myTree.addBranch('div', { id: 'branch1' });
    const leaf1 = branch1.addLeaf('p', 'This is a leaf');

    // Create ants with specific names
    const clickScout = new ClickScout((event) => console.log('Clicked!', event), { dataCarrier });
    const dataWorker = new DataWorker((data) => console.log('Working with', data));
    const dataCarrier = new DataCarrier('myData', 'Some data');
    const queenAnt = new QueenAnt('MyClass', class {
        constructor(name) {
            this.name = name;
        }
    });
    const guardAnt = new GuardAnt((request) => {
        // Security logic here
        return request.isValid;
    });

    // Use ants to manipulate the tree
    branch1.addAnt(clickScout);
    leaf1.addAnt(dataWorker);
    myTree.addAnt(dataCarrier);
    myTree.addAnt(queenAnt);
    myTree.addAnt(guardAnt);

    // Example of event triggering
    branch1.triggerEvent('click');

    // Example of security check
    const request = { isValid: true };
    if (myTree.checkAccess(request)) {
        console.log('Access granted');
    } else {
        console.log('Access denied');
    }
    ```
